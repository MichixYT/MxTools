# MxTools
Polish README: 

MxTools is an Essential plugin that adds many features, including: chat format (in the MxToolsChat add-on), spawn and players homes (in the MxToolsSpawn add-on) and an economy that requires a Vault (in the MxToolsEco add-on). It is a replacement plugin for Essentials or EssentialsX, it runs on versions 1.12.2+. The plugin was written on spigot, so it may not work on the bukkit
